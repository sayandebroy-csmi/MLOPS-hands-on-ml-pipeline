7. Do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline automation.

Experiments with DVC:
9.  pip install dvclive
10. Do "dvc exp run", it will create a new dvc.yaml(if already not there) and dvclive directory (each run will be considered as an Experiments).
11. Do "dvc exp show" on terminal to see the experiments or use extensions on vscode (install dvc extension)
12. Do "dvc exp remove {exp-name}" to remove exp (optional) | "dvc exp apply {exp-name}" to reproduce prev exp.
13. Change params, re-run code (produce new experiments)
14. Now git add, commit, push.
